What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking the files in this repository/folder. It creates a hidden folder (.git) to track all these information.
Also there is no initial commit when we initialize a repo, we should do it manually when needed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area consists only of those files which we think are complete for our next commit , We do not add those files to the staging area
which we don't want to add. Also staging area is not a part of either of the working directory or repository. These are those changes which will we committed once we commit . We can think of staging area as an unique part of working directory which is less likely to change in the future if there is not a bug or major feature change in our project.

change?
